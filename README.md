# hello_golang
Just a repo where I test some basic Golang features. I am trying to decide whether or not to do Golang this year for Advent of Code instead of Rust

Initial thoughs:
  - I like the simple syntax, that is very nice.
  - Reminds me of C, which is a language that I used heavily in college so it has a nice familiar feeling
  
  - I do not like single letter variable names, why is this a thing?
  - I also don't like automatic semicolon insertion. I'm sure everyone else loves it but it feels weird to me.

I will continue to play around with it and see how I feel about it. I am not sure if I will do Advent of Code in Golang yet, but I am leaning towards it. I think it would be a good learning experience. I still need to evaluate how easy it is to read in and parse text since that is pretty important for Advent of Code. It's not exactly easy in Rust but the tools are all there.
